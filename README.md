<H1>Before running this repo on your own repository:</H1>

<UL>
<LI>Update the jenkinsfile to specify your own GitHub Repo URL and name (1 location)
<LI>Add your Jenkins IP webhook to each repo (1 location/optional)
<LI>Update the project domain name in the BLUE/terraform.tfvars (project_domain = "ochoajenkins.com") to reflect your own domain name.
<LI>Update the project domain name in the GREEN/terraform.tfvars (project_domain = "ochoajenkins.com") to reflect your own domain name.
<LI>Update the project domain name in the production/terraform.tfvars (project_domain = "ochoajenkins.com") to reflect your own domain name.
<LI>Update the bucket name is BLUE/bootstrap.tf to reflect a unique bucket name for the blue deployment. e.g. 01-lastname-prod-blue
<LI>Update the bucket name is GREEN/bootstrap.tf to reflect a unique bucket name for the green deployment. e.g. 01-last-name-prod-green
<LI>Update the bucket name is production/bootstrap.tf to reflect a unique bucket name for the blue deployment. e.g. 01-last-name-prod
<LI>Replace the "DevOps" key in the BLUE/ec2_test.tf file with an existing key pair in your AWS account. For example, the Jenkins key pair.
